1. Script path and files :

[root@genie-utility monitoring_nfs]# pwd
/home/monitoring_nfs
[root@genie-utility monitoring_nfs]#
[root@genie-utility monitoring_nfs]# ll
total 44
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Aug 11 09:41 keys
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   193 Aug 26 14:01 nfs_bkup
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1408 Aug 26 14:08 nfs_mount_check.cfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 12566 Aug 26 14:00 vm_restart.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   442 Aug 26 14:01 vm_restart_script_test
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15328 Aug 26 14:00 vm_restart_script_trigger.py
[root@genie-utility monitoring_nfs]#

2. Config file "nfs_mount_check.cfg" with entries for all deployments :

Example entry for a deployment :

[rfpsmallstaging]
key=/home/monitoring_nfs/keys/rfpsmallstaging_cu_key.pem
ips=10.100.130.17, 10.100.130.10

NOTE : This file is ready with details of all deployments. Also, the "keys" folder contains valid
keys of each deployment. This is same as the script on "nmassscriptbox".

3. Script execution :

/usr/bin/python vm_restart_script_trigger.py <deployment_name> '<vm_list_comma_saparated>'

NOTE : VM list can contain "name" (as per consul member) or "ip address". Invalid name or IP address
 are skipped.

Example :

/usr/bin/python vm_restart_script_trigger.py rfpsmallstaging 'rfpsmallstaging-mssnmpcm-1, rfpsmallstaging-dpmediation-1, 10.200.2.84, rfpsmallstaging-scp-1  , rfpsmallstaging-mscmip-1   , 10.200.2.70   , 10.200.2.78 '


4. Script execution flow :

i. Validate that the VM list count is not greater than 10.
ii. Copy "vm_restart.py" script to EMP node
iii. Execute "vm_restart.py" script on EMP node and parse the response.
-> Here, invalid name or IP address are ignored, and VM which have consul process not running are
skipped.
iv. Sleep for 60 seconds before checking valid VM status
v. Wait for all valid VM status to become "alive"
-> Polls every 30 seconds, with timeout of 5 minutes.
vi. Sleep for 180 seconds before checking VM healthcheck status
vii. Wait for all valid VM healtchecks to be passed
-> Polls every 30 seconds, with timeout of 5 minutes.

NOTE :
"Invalid or Failed (to kill consul process) VMs LIST" in are also listed in the logs
-> The table mentions list of VMs that are either invalid or the consul was not running on these VMs
